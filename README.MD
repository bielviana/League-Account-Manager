## What is it?
Account manager to make life easier for those who have a lot of smurfs in League of Legends.

## Why did I?
I decided to develop this app because I was too lazy to copy and paste usernames and passwords all the time while switching between my lol accounts.

## Build guide
**First I recommend creating a virtual env to get started.**

1. Copy the **`scripts\build.py`** file to the **`leagueaccountmanager`** folder.

2. Install the necessary libraries.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Through the command prompt (or powershell, whatever), go to the **`leagueaccountmanager`** folder and run the command below to build
```
python build.py build
```
PS: All assets you add must be listed in the **`files`** variable of the **`build.py`** file

4. Your executable will be in the **`leagueaccountmanager\build`** folder along with the necessary libraries.
